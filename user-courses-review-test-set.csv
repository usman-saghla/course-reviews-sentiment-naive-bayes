"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",4,"The course is well written, with no errors, and the visuals are accurate, but these are just the standard of professional work - it is noticeable that the videos are made with AI, and that the voice is also AI generated. I understand that this is to save time, however it does make the journey rather emotionally disconnected and there is no instructor and no real journey. These should be integrated into your program, because every single person has a heros journey, a process of development they are on, a story, if you will. And if you are part of that story, you will build customers who feel emotionally attached to your education and your platform, and will be loyal to you. Also, adding some more interesting visualizations (the infographic was excellent, and so we're the robots, actually really nice, but they were rare) - and perhaps a minigame of some kind to play with the different parts. 

One idea 💡 was a data analyst builder, where you can mix and match different pieces and see what's made. For example, I want to learn SQL, Python, and I want remote work and storytelling, tableau - I'm essentially building a BI Developer / Consultant. This would give a much more in depth understanding of not only the skills in this field, but where they fit and show up in the infographic, and it would also clarify the links between skills and jobs, really bringing this entire section home.
